## Development Process

1. Fork and Pull the Code

Fork the G6 repository on Github to your account, then clone it locally.

```bash
# Navigate to your workspace
cd /path/to/your/workspace

# Navigate to the G6 directory
git clone git@github.com:[your username]/G6.git
```

2. Install Dependencies

:::warning{title=Warning}
Please ensure your local environment meets the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version >= 18
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) version >= 8

:::

```bash
# Enter the G6 code directory
cd G6

# Install Dependencies
pnpm install
```

3. Start the Development Environment

```bash
# Enter the g6 code directory.
cd ./packages/g6

# Start the development environment
pnpm dev
```

At this point, you can access G6's development environment and preview the examples by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your web browser.

4. Develop New Features or Fix Bugs

Switch to a development branch:

```bash
git checkout -b [branch name]
```

Make code modifications according to your needs and test locally.

5. Write Test Cases

In the `packages/g6/__tests__/unit` directory, write test cases to ensure your code behaves as expected.

Validate Your Code with Testsï¼š

```bash
pnpm test
```

6. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit Changes
git commit -m "[commit type]: commit message"

# Push to Your Repository
git push
```

Submit a Pull Request (PR) to the G6 repository on GitHub.

## Testing and Coverage

G6 utilizes Jest for conducting unit tests, with the test cases situated in the `packages/g6/__tests__/unit` directory.

We require that all code submissions must pass tests to ensure code quality.

The coverage rate for the current PR (Pull Request) submission is advised not to fall below the coverage rate of the existing codebase, and it is <text style="color: red;">not to fall below 90%</text>.

## Code Standards

The G6 code adheres to the following standards:

- eslint:recommended
- @typescript-eslint/recommended
- jsdoc/recommended-error

## Commit Conventions

G6 adopts the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification, and the commit message format is as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

The type field can be one of the following:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation update
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- revert: Reverts a previous commit

For example:

```
feat: add new feature
refactor(behavior): refactor drag-canvas behavior
```

Please ensure that your commit messages conform to the standards, and try to use English descriptions whenever possible. This helps us better manage the code.

## Pull Request (PR) Standards

After completing the above steps, you can submit a PR to the G6 repository. Please ensure that your PR adheres to the following standards:

- A single PR should address only one issue.
- The title of the PR should be concise and clear.
- The description of the PR should be clear and detailed. If the changes involve the user interface, please include screenshots.
- The PR must pass CI (Continuous Integration) checks.

## Code Review

After your PR is submitted, we will review your code. Please be patient and await the results of the review. If there are any areas that require modification, we will point them out within the PR.

## Release Process

We regularly release new versions. If your PR is for a non-urgent bug fix, it will be included in the next release. If your PR addresses an urgent bug fix, we will release a new version as soon as possible.
