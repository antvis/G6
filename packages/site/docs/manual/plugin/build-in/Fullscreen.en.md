## Overview

The Fullscreen plugin allows users to expand the graph visualization content to the entire screen, providing a broader view and a better immersive experience.

## Use Cases

The Fullscreen plugin is mainly suitable for the following scenarios:

- Provide a broader view for viewing complex graph data
- Enhance immersive experience, focusing on graph visualization content
- Display graph data in presentations or reports

## Basic Usage

Below is a simple example of initializing the Fullscreen plugin:

```js
const graph = new Graph({
  plugins: [
    {
      type: 'fullscreen',
      autoFit: true,
      trigger: {
        request: 'F', // Use shortcut key F to enter fullscreen
        exit: 'Esc', // Use shortcut key Esc to exit fullscreen
      },
      onEnter: () => {
        console.log('Entered fullscreen mode');
      },
      onExit: () => {
        console.log('Exited fullscreen mode');
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

### trigger

The trigger property is used to control the method of triggering fullscreen. It supports two configuration methods:

#### Shortcut Key Configuration

Use keyboard shortcuts to trigger fullscreen and exit fullscreen.

```js
const graph = new Graph({
  plugins: [
    {
      type: 'fullscreen',
      trigger: {
        request: 'F', // Use shortcut key F to enter fullscreen
        exit: 'Esc', // Use shortcut key Esc to exit fullscreen
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Custom Trigger

Control fullscreen by calling the request and exit methods.

```js
const graph = new Graph({
  plugins: [
    {
      type: 'fullscreen',
      key: 'my-fullscreen',
    },
  ],
});

// Enter fullscreen
graph.getPluginInstance('my-fullscreen').request();

// Exit fullscreen
graph.getPluginInstance('my-fullscreen').exit();
```

### autoFit

Whether to auto-fit the canvas size, the canvas size will automatically adapt to the screen size when fullscreen.

- When set to true, the canvas will automatically resize to fit the entire screen.
- When set to false, the canvas size remains unchanged.

```js
const graph = new Graph({
  plugins: [
    {
      type: 'fullscreen',
      autoFit: true,
    },
  ],
});
```

## API

### Fullscreen.request()

This method is used to enter fullscreen mode programmatically. It can be called on the plugin instance to expand the graph visualization to the entire screen.

```js
const graph = new Graph({
  plugins: [
    {
      type: 'fullscreen',
      key: 'my-fullscreen',
    },
  ],
});

// Enter fullscreen
graph.getPluginInstance('my-fullscreen').request();
```

### Fullscreen.exit()

This method is used to exit fullscreen mode programmatically. It can be called on the plugin instance to revert the graph visualization back to its original size.

```js
const graph = new Graph({
  plugins: [
    {
      type: 'fullscreen',
      key: 'my-fullscreen',
    },
  ],
});

// Exit fullscreen
graph.getPluginInstance('my-fullscreen').exit();
```
