title: EdgeBundling
---

## Overview

Edge bundling is a graph visualization technique used to reduce visual clutter in complex network graphs and to reveal high-level patterns and structures in the graph. Its purpose is to bundle adjacent edges together.

The edge bundling plugin provided in G6 is based on the implementation of the [FEDB (Force-Directed Edge Bundling for Graph Visualization)](https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/cse557/readings/holten-edgebundling.pdf) paper: modeling edges as flexible springs that can attract each other and bundling them through a self-organizing process.

## Use Cases

The edge bundling plugin is mainly suitable for the following scenarios:

- Reducing visual clutter in complex network graphs
- Revealing high-level patterns and structures in the graph
- Improving the readability and aesthetics of large-scale graph data

## Basic Usage

Below is a simple example of initializing the EdgeBundling plugin:

```js
const graph = new Graph({
  plugins: [
    {
      type: 'edge-bundling',
      bundleThreshold: 0.6,
      cycles: 6,
      divisions: 3,
      divRate: 2,
      iterations: 90,
      iterRate: 2 / 3,
      K: 0.1,
      lambda: 0.1,
    },
  ],
});
```

### bundleThreshold

Edge compatibility threshold, determines which edges should be bundled together. The larger the value, the fewer edges are bundled, and vice versa.

- A lower bundleThreshold value (e.g., 0.4) will cause more edges to be bundled together, forming a more pronounced bundling effect.

```js
const graph = new Graph({
  plugins: [
    {
      type: 'edge-bundling',
      bundleThreshold: 0.4, // Lower edge compatibility threshold
    },
  ],
});
```

The effect is as follows:

- A higher bundleThreshold value (e.g., 0.8) will cause fewer edges to be bundled together, maintaining more independent edges.

```js
const graph = new Graph({
  plugins: [
    {
      type: 'edge-bundling',
      bundleThreshold: 0.8, // Higher edge compatibility threshold
    },
  ],
});
```

The effect is as follows:

### K

Edge strength, affects the attraction and repulsion between edges. A higher K value will make the attraction between edges stronger, resulting in a tighter bundling effect.

- A lower K value (e.g., 0.05) will make the attraction between edges weaker, resulting in a weaker bundling effect.

```js
const graph = new Graph({
  plugins: [
    {
      type: 'edge-bundling',
      K: 0.05, // Lower edge strength
    },
  ],
});
```

The effect is as follows:

- A higher K value (e.g., 0.2) will make the attraction between edges stronger, resulting in a more pronounced bundling effect.

```js
const graph = new Graph({
  plugins: [
    {
      type: 'edge-bundling',
      K: 0.2, // Higher edge strength
    },
  ],
});
```

## Code Examples

### Basic Edge Bundling

The simplest way is to use the preset configuration directly:

```js
const graph = new Graph({
  // Other configurations...
  plugins: ['edge-bundling'],
});
```

### Custom Styles

You can customize the parameters of edge bundling as needed:

```js
const graph = new Graph({
  // Other configurations...
  plugins: [
    {
      type: 'edge-bundling',
      bundleThreshold: 0.8, // Higher edge compatibility threshold
      cycles: 8, // More simulation cycles
      K: 0.2, // Stronger edge strength
    },
  ],
});
```

### Dynamic Update of Edge Bundling

Use the key identifier to dynamically update edge bundling properties at runtime:

```js
// Initial configuration
const graph = new Graph({
  // Other configurations...
  plugins: [
    {
      type: 'edge-bundling',
      key: 'my-edge-bundling',
      bundleThreshold: 0.6,
    },
  ],
});

// Subsequent dynamic update
graph.updatePlugin({
  key: 'my-edge-bundling',
  bundleThreshold: 0.8, // Update edge compatibility threshold
  cycles: 10, // Update number of simulation cycles
});
```
