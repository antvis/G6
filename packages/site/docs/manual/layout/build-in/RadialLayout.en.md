## Overview

Radial layout arranges nodes in concentric circles by layers, which is suitable for visualizing hierarchical relationships, community structures, and more. It supports advanced features such as node overlap prevention and group sorting, making it ideal for various network visualizations.

## Usage Scenarios

- Displaying hierarchical structures (e.g., organization charts, family trees)
- Community structure analysis
- Highlighting a central node and its radiating relationships
- Complex networks requiring node grouping and sorting

## Configuration

```js
const graph = new Graph({
  layout: {
    type: 'radial',
    nodeSize: 32,
    unitRadius: 100,
    linkDistance: 200,
  },
  // other configs ...
});
```

## Code Example

### Basic Usage

```js
import { Graph } from '@antv/g6';

fetch('https://assets.antv.antgroup.com/g6/radial.json')
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => {
    const graph = new Graph({
      container: 'container',
      data,
      autoFit: 'center',
      layout: {
        type: 'radial',
        nodeSize: 32,
        unitRadius: 100,
        linkDistance: 200,
      },
      node: {
        style: {
          labelFill: '#fff',
          labelPlacement: 'center',
          labelText: (d) => d.id,
        },
      },
      behaviors: ['drag-canvas', 'drag-element'],
    });
    graph.render();
  });
```

The effect is as follows:
