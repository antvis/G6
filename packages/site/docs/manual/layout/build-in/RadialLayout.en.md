title: Radial Layout
---

## Overview

Radial layout is a graph layout algorithm that arranges nodes in concentric circles by layers. It is commonly used to display hierarchical relationships, community structures, and more. This layout supports advanced features such as node overlap prevention and group sorting, making it suitable for visualizing various network structures.

## Use Cases

- Displaying hierarchical structures (e.g., organizational charts, family trees)
- Community structure analysis
- Scenarios that need to highlight the central node and its radiating relationships
- Complex networks requiring node grouping and sorting

## Configuration

```js
const graph = new Graph({
  layout: {
    type: 'radial',
    nodeSize: 32,
    unitRadius: 100,
    linkDistance: 200,
  },
  // other configurations...
});
```

## Code Example

### Basic Usage

```js
import { Graph } from '@antv/g6';

fetch('https://assets.antv.antgroup.com/g6/radial.json')
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => {
    const graph = new Graph({
      container: 'container',
      data,
      autoFit: 'center',
      layout: {
        type: 'radial',
        nodeSize: 32,
        unitRadius: 100,
        linkDistance: 200,
      },
      node: {
        style: {
          labelFill: '#fff',
          labelPlacement: 'center',
          labelText: (d) => d.id,
        },
      },
      behaviors: ['drag-canvas', 'drag-element'],
    });
    graph.render();
  });
```
