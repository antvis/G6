### graph.getZoom()

Get the current zoom ratio.

**Return**

- Type of return value: Number;
- The return value indicates the current zoom ratio of view port. The default value is 1.

**Usage**

```javascript
// The return value indicates the current zoom ratio
const zoom = graph.getZoom();
```

### graph.zoom(ratio, center, animate, animateCfg)

Change the scale of the graph with a relative ratio.

**Parameters**

| Name   | Type   | Required | Description               |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ratio | Number | true | Relative zoom ratio |
| center | Object | false | The zoom center. If it is not assigned, (0, 0) will be regarded as the zoom center |
| animate | boolean | false | Whether move the graph with animation. If it is not assigned, animates following the graph's `animate`. |
| animateCfg | Object | false | The animation's configuraiton. Its configurations can be found in [Basic Animation Docs](/en/docs/manual/middle/animation). |

**Usage**

```javascript
// zoom to scale 3 at the center (100, 100)
graph.zoom(3, { x: 100, y: 100 });

// zoom to scale 0.5 at the center (0, 0)
graph.zoom(0.5);

// zoom to scale 3 at the center (100, 100) with animation
graph.zoom(3, { x: 100, y: 100 }, true, {
  duration: 100,
});
```

### graph.zoomTo(toRatio, center)

| center | Object | false | The zoom center. If it is not assigned, (0, 0) will be regarded as the zoom center |
| animate | boolean | false | Whether move the graph with animation. If it is not assigned, animates following the graph's `animate`. |
| animateCfg | Object | false | The animation's configuraiton. Its configurations can be found in [Basic Animation Docs](/en/docs/manual/middle/animation). |

**Usage**

```javascript
// Scale the graph 3 times at the center (100, 100)
graph.zoomTo(3, { x: 100, y: 100 });

// Scale the graph 0.5 times at the center (0, 0)
graph.zoomTo(0.5);

// Scale the graph 3 times at the center (100, 100) with animation
graph.zoomTo(3, { x: 100, y: 100 }, true, {
  duration: 100,
});
```


### graph.changeSize(width, height)

| animate | boolean | false | Whether translate the graph with animation. |
| animateCfg | Object | false | The animation's configuraiton. Its configurations can be found in [Basic Animation Docs](/en/docs/manual/middle/animation). If it is not assigned, animates following the graph's `animateCfg`. |

**Usage**
