## controlPoint

> _[number, number] \| [number, number, number] \| Float32Array_

Control point. Used to define the shape of the curve. If not specified, it will be calculated using `curveOffset` and `curvePosition`<!-- -->.

## curveOffset

> _number_ **Default:** `30`

The distance of the control point from the line

## curvePosition

> _number_ **Default:** `0.5`

The relative position of the control point on the line, ranging from `0-1`
