## labelBackgroundShape

**Type**: `LabelBackgroundShapeStyle`

<details>

<summary style="color: #873bf4; cursor: pointer">LabelBackgroundShapeStyle</summary>

```typescript
type LabelBackgroundShapeStyle = ShapeStyle & {
  /**
   * The padding distance between the text and the background rectangle in all directions
   */
  padding?: number | number[];
};
```

The related shape style can be referred to as RectStyleProps [`RectStyleProps`](../shape/RectStyleProps.en.md).

</details>

**Default**: undefined

The background shape of the text in the Combo, which is a rectangle. If not set, it will not be displayed. Setting it as `{}` will use the default style in the theme to display the text background shape.

## haloShape

**Type**: `HaloShapeStyle`

<details>

<summary style="color: #873bf4; cursor: pointer">HaloShapeStyle</summary>

```typescript
type HaloShapeStyle = ShapeStyle;
```

`ShapeStyle`, where the type of haloShape follows the key shape (keyShape). The configuration options for different key shapes are different. For example, the key shape of `'circle-combo'` is `'circle'` (refer to [Circle Shape Style](../shape/CircleStyleProps.en.md)), and the key shape of `'rect-combo'` is `'rect'` (refer to [Rect Shape Style](../shape/RectStyleProps.en.md)).

</details>

**Default**: undefined

In the built-in Combo and themes, `haloShape` refers to the halo effect displayed around the key shape (`keyShape`) of the Combo in the `active` state (usually triggered when the mouse hovers) and `selected` state (usually triggered when selected). In the logic of the built-in Combo, the type and color of the `haloShape` follow the key shape (`keyShape`).

## badgeShapes

   */
  [key: number]: ShapeStyle & {
    /**
     * The position of the badge, supported values are described below
     */
    position?: IBadgePosition;
    /**
     * The background color of the badge
     */
    color?: string;
    /**

     */
    textColor?: string;

 */
type AnchorShapesStyle = StyleProps & {
  /**
   * Individual anchor shape configurations, with higher priority than the outer CircleStyleProps.
   */
  [key: number]: CircleStyleProps & {
    /**
     * The position of the anchor shape, can be configured as a string or a number array representing the percentage position relative to the bounding box of the key shape (keyShape). For example, [0.5, 1] means it is located at the right center of the key shape.
     */
    position?: 'top' | 'left' | 'bottom' | 'right' | [number, number];
  };
};
```

The style of the anchor shapes can be referred to as [CircleStyleProps](../shape/CircleStyleProps.en.md).

   * The value is the shape style configuration (which varies depending on the shape, see the relevant documentation for each shape), as well as the animation of the shape.
   */
