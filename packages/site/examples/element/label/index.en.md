Proccess the long label in G6.

## Usage

When the label of node or edge has long text, we recommend to calculate the length by JS, and use `\n` to wrap the worlds. G6 has `Util.getLetterWidth` and `Util.getTextSize` to help users to calculate the length of the text, but they are only precise for default font family.
