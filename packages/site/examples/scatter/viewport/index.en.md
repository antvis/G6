Configure animtions for viewport move, zoom, fitView, fitCenter, etc.

### Usage

Viewport update with animations could be achieved easily by configuring `animate` and `animateCfg` to the corresponding APIs, e.g. `graph.translate`, `graph.moveTo`, `graph.zoom`, `graph.zoomTo`, `graph.fitView`, `graph.fitCenter`, `graph.focusItem`. Please refer to the document [Graph Viewport API](/en/docs/api/graph-func/transform).
