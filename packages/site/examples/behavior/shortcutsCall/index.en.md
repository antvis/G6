G6 provides shortcuts-call interactions that support call a graph API by shortcuts.

## Usage

The shortcuts-call interaction is provided by the official G6 library, but it is not registered by default. It needs to be imported into the code and registered with the `extend` method, and then you could configured it to the graph instance.
