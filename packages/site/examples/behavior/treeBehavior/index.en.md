## Move Subtree

Move a subtree to a new parent by dragging the root node of the subtree. Drag the root node of the subtree to get closed to a new parent which is not a descendant node of the dragged node, drop the node to finish.


## Onload Data to TreeGraph

Click the nodes on the tree graph to onload multiple data. The following demos show two ways to load data:

- `graph.changeData`;
- `graph.addChild`;

## Collapse the Sibling Nodes

Click a node to collapse the sibling nodes with same data type.
