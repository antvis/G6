Timebar is a build-in Component in G6, but not reigstered by default. It needs to be imported into the code and registered with the `extend` method, and then you could configured it to the graph instance.

## Usage

The demo below show how to use timebar on graph. Timebar's style can be defined by the CSS with class name `g6-component-timebar`:

```css
.g6-component-timebar {
  // css styles
}
```
