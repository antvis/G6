Fisheye is a built-in components in G6, but not reigstered by default. It needs to be imported into the code and registered with the `extend` method, and then you could configured it to the graph instance.

## Usage

Fisheye is designed for focus+context exploration, it keeps the context and the relationships between context and the focus while magnifing the focus area. The demo below shows how to use fisheye on graph. And the Fisheye lens's style can be configured by `delegateStyle`. The API can be found at [Fisheye Plugin](/en/docs/api/Plugins#fisheye).
