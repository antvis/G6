# Translation Guidelines for site/docs

When translating files under the `site/docs` directory, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Consistency in Terminology**: Ensure that terminology is consistent throughout the document. Use a glossary if available to maintain uniformity in terms.

   **Glossary**:

   - 画布 (Canvas)
   - 元素 (Eleme)
   - 节点 (Node)
   - 边 (Edge)
   - 组合 (Combo)
   - 交互 (Behavior)
   - 布局 (Layout)
   - 插件 (Plugin)
   - 动画 (Animation)
   - 数据处理 (Transform)
   - 色板 (Palette)
   - 配置项 (Option)
   - 图数据 (Graph Data)
   - 树图 (Tree Graph)
   - 属性 (Property)
   - 描述 (Description)
   - 类型 (Type)
   - 默认值 (Default Value)
   - 必选 (Required)

2. **Adjust Hyperlinks**: Review and adjust hyperlinks to ensure they point to the correct translated sections or documents. Verify that all links are functional and correctly formatted.

   - **Internal Links**: In the English version, all internal links should have a `/en` prefix, while the Chinese version should not have any prefix. Ensure this prefix is added to all internal links in English documents to avoid any oversight.
   - **Anchor Points**: For anchor points following a `#`, if they contain Chinese characters, they should be adjusted to match the corresponding title in the English version rather than being directly translated.
   - **External Links**: Convert external links appropriately to ensure they align with the language and context of the document.

3. **Direct Writing to Translated Documents**: Translations should be stored in corresponding `.en.md` or `.zh.md` files within the same directory. Ensure that the translated content is placed in the correct location within the document.

   - When translating from Chinese to English, create or update the `.en.md` file in the same directory.
   - When translating from English to Chinese, create or update the `.zh.md` file in the same directory.

4. **Support for Partial Content Translation**: Allow for the selection and translation of specific sections of content. Translated sections should be inserted into the appropriate location within the document, maintaining the logical flow and structure.

   - **Full Document Translation**: If the entire document is selected for translation, replace the entire content with the translated version.
   - **Partial Content Translation**: If only specific sections are selected, find the appropriate place to replace or insert the translated content, ensuring the document's logical flow and structure are maintained.

5. **Contextual Translation**: Avoid literal translations. Ensure that the translation fits the English context and conveys the intended meaning accurately.

6. **Direct Modification**: Translations should be directly modified in the corresponding `.en.md` or `.zh.md` files without returning the translated content separately. Ensure that the changes are saved in the correct file and location.

7. **Preserve Metadata Order**: Do not modify the `order` attribute in the page metadata during translation. This ensures that the document order remains consistent across different language versions.

By following these guidelines, translations will be more accurate and consistent, facilitating easier review and integration into the documentation.
