# Issue Hunt Program

## What is the Issue Hunt Program?

The Issue Hunt Program is an incentive program proposed by AntV to encourage community contributors to participate in the AntV project.

## How to Participate in Issue Hunt?

1. Find an issue that interests you. (issue with 'IH: Reward/ reward' tag)
2. Contribute code to the issue.
3. Earn rewards.

## How to Find Issues You Like?

- Find issues that interest you on [Issue Hunt](https://oss.issuehunt.io/r/antvis/G6/issues)
- Find issues you like on [GitHub](https://github.com/antvis/G6/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22IH%3A+Reward%2F%E6%82%AC%E8%B5%8F%22)

## Set Rewards for Issues

Both project maintainers and community contributors can set rewards for issues.

If you are a project maintainer, you can set the reward amount for an issue by using a label. For example:

`IH: Reward/悬赏`, `$10` means the reward amount for this issue is $10.

If you are a community contributor, you can reward the issue **you proposed** or the issue **you want to be resolved** on [Issue Hunt](https://oss.issuehunt.io/r/antvis/G6/issues).

> ⚠️ Issue Hunt platform may charge a certain fee.。

## Reward Amounts

The reward amounts for project maintainers are divided into three tiers:

- **Low Difficulty**：`$0.5` - `$5`
  - Simple question replies, documentation modifications, issue resolutions, new feature development
  - Workload within 2 hours (Evaluated by the project maintainer)
- **Medium Difficulty**：`$5` - `$10`
  - Requires some code modifications
  - Workload within 2 day
- **High Difficulty**：`$10` - `$50` (no upper limit in principle)
  - Requires extensive code modifications
  - Fixes critical and urgent issues
  - Complex new feature development
  - Workload within 2 week

## Reward Distribution

If a reward is initiated through the Issue Hunt platform, Issue Hunt will distribute the reward amount to the contributor's account within 7 days after the issue is closed.

If a reward is initiated by a project maintainer through GitHub, we will distribute rewards to closed issues based on the [Milestone](https://github.com/antvis/G6/milestones) schedule. Prior to distribution, we will contact the contributor to confirm the reward amount and distribution method.

## Issue Claiming

To avoid multiple people claiming the same issue simultaneously, you can leave a comment below an issue marked with IH: Reward/悬赏. The project maintainer will reply within 24 hours to confirm if you can claim the issue and add the IH: Claimed/已认领 label to the issue.

Your claiming comment should include the following information (copy and edit the template to reply):
