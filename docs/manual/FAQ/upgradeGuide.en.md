## The Built Outcomes of esm and commonjs

The built outcomes of esm and commonjs do not support layouts with Web-Worker.

## The Built Outcomes

G6 3.3.0 supports three build outcomes:

- lib: commonjs;
- es: esm;
- dist: umd.

`import G6 from '@antv/g6'` default use lib outcomes。

The built outcomes of esm and commonjs do not support layouts with Web-Worker.

if you want to support layouts with Web-Worker, please use the file of [CDN](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/antv/pkg/_antv.g6-3.7.1/dist/g6.min.js).

## Util

- You don't need export @antv/util again after importing @antv/util in G6. The methods in @antv/util can be used directly;
- util/layout is removed:
  - The methods `scaleMatrix`, `floydWarshall`, and `getAdjMatrix` in util/layout have been moved to util.math;
  - The method `getEDistance` in util/layout was the same as the method `distance` in util/math. Please use `distance` in util/math;
  - Use the methods `mix`, `augment`, and `isString` in @antv/util instead of these in util/layout;
- `groupData` is changed into `group`；
- The methods `flatToTree` and `addNodesToParentNode` are removed from util/group;
- The dependency to @antv/util in base is removed.

## The Usage of Plugins

You don't need to import other packages when you are using the built-in plugins of G6. Only use them by `G6.PluginName` after import G6. e.g.

```javascript
// <= G6 3.2
// Import by CDN. you need import G6 and the plugins you need.
<script src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/antv/assets/lib/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/antv/pkg/_antv.g6-3.1.0/build/minimap.js"></script>
<script src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/antv/pkg/_antv.g6-3.1.0/build/grid.js"></script>
// Or import by NPM.  you need import G6 and the plugins you need.
import G6, { Minimap, Grid } from '@antv/G6'

const minimap = new Minimap({
	//... configurations
})
const grid = new Grid({
	//... configurations
})


// G6 3.5.10
// Import by CDN. Yuo only need to import G6.
<script src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/antv/pkg/_antv.g6-3.5.10/dist/g6.min.js"></script>
// Or import by NPM. Yuo only need to import G6.
import G6 from '@antv/G6'

const minimap = new G6.Minimap({
	//... configurations
})

const grid = new G6.Grid({
	//... configurations
})

const graph = new G6.Graph({
	//... other configurations
  plugins: [ minimap, grid ]
});
```

## Tree-Graph

In G6 3.3, The methods about layout in TreeGraph are unified as Graph:

1. `changeLayout` is changed into `updateLayout`;
1. `refreshLayout` is changed into `layout`.

## Animation

In G6 3.2.x and its previous version, the usage of the shape animation is:

```javascript
G6.registerEdge(
  'loop-growth',
  {
    afterDraw(cfg, group) {
      const shape = group.get('children')[0];
      const length = shape.getTotalLength();
      shape.animate(
        {
          onFrame(ratio) {
            const startLen = ratio * length;
            // Calculating the lineDash for the line
            const cfg = {
              lineDash: [startLen, length - startLen],
            };
            return cfg;
          },
          repeat: true,
        },
        2000,
      );
    },
  },
  'loop',
);
```

In G6 3.3:

- We suggest not to use the calling way in 3.2 with the rewriten `onFrame` function, which will be discarded soon;
- Call `animate` by two ways instead:
  - Way 1: `animate(toAttrs, animateCfg)`, where `toAttrs` is the target attributes of this animation, and `animateCfg` is the configuration of the animation. e.g.

```javascript
G6.registerEdge(
  'widen-line',
  {
    afterDraw(cfg, group) {
      const shape = group.get('children')[0];
      const length = shape.getTotalLength();
      shape.animate(
        {
          lineWidth: 10,
        },
        {
          repeat: false,
          duration: 500,
        },
      );
    },
  },
  'single-edge',
);
```

- Way 2: `animate(onFrame, animateCfg)`, where `onFrame` is the callback function of each frame, and `animateCfg` is the configurations of the animation. e.g.

```javascript
G6.registerEdge(
  'loop-growth',
  {
    afterDraw(cfg, group) {
      const shape = group.get('children')[0];
      const length = shape.getTotalLength();
      shape.animate(
        (ratio) => {
          const startLen = ratio * length;
          // Calculating the lineDash for the line
          const cfg = {
            lineDash: [startLen, length - startLen],
          };
          return cfg;
        },
        {
          repeat: true,
          duration: 2000,
        },
      );
    },
  },
  'loop',
);
```

## The Type of the Node/Edge

In G6 3.2.x and its previous versions, you can assign the type for edges and nodes in data, or assign them globally when instantiating the Graph, e.g.

```javascript
// Assign the type of edges/nodes in data
const data = {
  nodes: [
    {
      id: 'node0',
      shape: 'circle', // the type of this node is circle
    },
    {
      id: 'node1',
      shape: 'rect', // the type of this node is rect
    },
  ],
  edges: [
    {
      id: 'edge0',
      source: 'node0',
      target: 'node1',
      shape: 'polyline', // the type of this edge is polyline
    },
  ],
};
// or assign them globally when instantiating the Graph
const graph = new Graph({
  // ... other configurations for graph
  defaultNode: {
    shape: 'circle',
    // ... other configurations for default node
  },
});
```

In G6 3.3, please use **`type` instead of `shape`** (For now, the `shape` is comatible. But it will be discarded in the future).

## Cumstom Node/Edge

## fontSize

The fontSize of label in G6 3.3 and G6 3.2.x will result in different visual sizes. But if you are using the default fontSize(12), there will be no difference. This is due to the unreasonable matrix tranformation for label in previous version of G6's rendering engine, which is resolved in G6 3.3. Now, the visual size is more reasonable and accurate.

#### Adding a Shape

In G6 3.2 and previous versions, you can add a shape to a custom node or edge as following without assign `name` and `draggable`:

```javascript
G6.registerEdge('customNode', {
  draw(cfg, group) {
    const keyShape = group.addShape('rect', {
      attrs: {
        // ... The attributes of the graphic shape
      },
    });
    const circle = group.addShape('circle', {
      attrs: {
        // ... The attributes of the graphic shape
      },
    });
    return keyShape;
  },
});
```

In G6 3.3, we highly recommend you to assign `name` and `draggable` when adding a shape. If not, the shapes will not response some interactive events. Adding these two property as below:

```javascript
G6.registerEdge('customNode', {
  draw(cfg, group) {
    const keyShape = group.addShape('rect', {
      attrs: {
        // ... The attributes of the graphic shape
      },
      draggable: true, // Allow this shape to be dragged
      name: 'key-shape', // Not unique, you can assign any string value to it
    });
    const circle = group.addShape('circle', {
      attrs: {
        // ... The attributes of the graphic shape
      },
      draggable: true, // Allow this shape to be dragged
      name: 'circle-shape', // Not unique, you can assign any string value to it
    });
    return keyShape;
  },
});
```

#### marker

In G6 3.2 and previous versions, the radius of the marker was assigned by `r` or `radius`.

In G6 3.3, the radius of marker can be assigned by `r` only.

e.g.

```javascript
// <= G6 3.2.x
G6.registerEdge('customNode', {
  draw(cfg, group) {
    const marker = group.addShape('marker', {
      attrs: {
        // ... Other attributes
        radius: cfg.size[0],
      },
      draggable: true,
      name: 'marker-shape',
    });
    return keyShape;
  },
});

// <= G6 3.3
G6.registerEdge('customNode', {
  draw(cfg, group) {
    const marker = group.addShape('marker', {
      attrs: {
        // ... Other attributes
        r: cfg.size[0],
      },
      draggable: true,
      name: 'marker-shape',
    });
    return keyShape;
  },
});
```

#### fan

In G6 3.2.x and previous version, we support fan shape (usage is shown below). G6 3.3 does not support this shape any more.

```javascript
// This is not supported in G6 3.3
group.addShape('fan', {
  attrs: {
    x: 50,
    y: 50,
    re: 40,
    rs: 30,
    startAngle: (1 / 2) * Math.PI,
    endAngle: Math.PI,
    clockwise: false,
    fill: '#b7eb8f',
  },
});
```

## pixelRatio

In G6 3.2 and previous versions, you need to assign the `pixelRatio` when instantiating the Graph.

In G6 3.3, `pixelRatio` will be calculated automatically.

## The Timing Event of click-select and brush-select

In G6 3.2 and previous versions, The timing `nodeselectchange` will be emitted when end-users make some change by `brush-select` and `click-select`. There were two properties in the callback function of `nodeselectchange` for `brush-select`:

- `targets`: The selected nodes and edges currently as `{nodes: [...], edges: [...]}`
- `select`: Whether the option is select or deselect currently. `true` | `false`

There were two another properties in the callback function of `nodeselectchange` for `click-select`:

- `target`: The manipulated node currently. It might be selected or deselected
- `select`: Whether the option is select or deselect currently. `true` | `false`

G6 3.3 unifies the `nodeselectchange` events in these two behaviors. The `targets` is replaced by `selectedItems`, which means the selected nodes and edges currently, to avoid the confusion of the meanings of `targets` and `target`.

<br />Now, there two properties in the callback function of `nodeselectchange` for `brush-select`:

- `selectedItems`: The selected nodes and edges currently as `{nodes: [...], edges: [...]}`
- `select`: Whether the option is select or deselect currently. `true` | `false`

There three properties in the callback function of `nodeselectchange` for `click-select`:

- `target`: The manipulated node currently. It might be selected or deselected
- `selectedItems`: The selected nodes and edges currently as `{nodes: [...], edges: [...]}`
- `select`: Whether the option is select or deselect currently. `true` | `false`

## SVG Renderer

In G6 3.2 and previous versions, you can assign the renderer with options options `'canvas'` and `'svg'` for graph when instantiating the Graph.

In G6 3.3, to make a better version with canvas, we do not support SVG renderer temporary. But we will support it in the future.
