> `p` is the flag for using texture; the text in green can be modified to satisfy your requirements; `a` is a way of repeating of the texture, which can be changed into:

> • `a`: Repeat in horizontal and vertical;

> • `x`: Repeat only in horizontal;

> • `y`: Repeat only in vertical;

> • `n`: No repeat.

Assign the `fill` as below while [Configurating the Node or Edge](/en/docs/manual/tutorial/elements):

```
shape.attr('fill', 'p(a)https://gw.alipay.com/cube.png');
```
