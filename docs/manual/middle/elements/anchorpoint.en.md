The anchorPoint of a node is the link point where the related edges link to. In other words, it is the intersection of a node and its related edges. anchorPoints is a 2d array, each element represents the position of one anchor point. The positions of the anchor points in a [Shape](/en/docs/manual/middle/keyconcept/shape-keyshape) are shown below, the range of each x and y is [0, 1]:<br /> <img src='https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_f8c6a0/afts/img/A*EJTyR4j9VN4AAAAAAAAAAABkARQnAQ' width='600' height='300' alt='img'/>

You can select the link points for an edge by `sourceAnchor` and `targetAnchor` if there are anchorPoints in the source and target node. Where This `sourceAnchor` and `targetAnchor` indicate the index of the array of anchorPoints. mechanism beautifies the graphs when there are multiple edges between two nodes.

The data below shows how to configure the anchorPoints on a node and link points for an edge:

```javascript
const data = {
  nodes: [
    {
      id: 'node1',
      label: 'node1',
      x: 100,
      y: 200,
      // There are two anchorPoints for this node
      anchorPoints: [
        [0, 1],
        [0.5, 1],
      ],
      type: 'rect',
    },
    {
      id: 'node2',
      label: 'node2',
      x: 300,
      y: 400,
      // There are two anchorPoints for this node
      anchorPoints: [
        [0.5, 0],
        [1, 0.5],
      ],
      type: 'rect',
    },
  ],
  edges: [
    {
      source: 'node1',
      target: 'node2',
      // The source link point of the edge is the 0-th anchorPoint of the source node
      sourceAnchor: 0,
      // The target link point of the edge is the 0-th anchorPoint of the target node
      targetAnchor: 0,
      style: {
        endArrow: true,
      },
    },
    {
      source: 'node2',
      target: 'node1',
      // The source link point of the edge is the 1-st anchorPoint of the source node
      sourceAnchor: 1,
      // The target link point of the edge is the 1-st anchorPoint of the target node
      targetAnchor: 1,
      style: {
        endArrow: true,
      },
    },
  ],
};
```
