## What is Behavior

Behavior is the interaction mechanism in G6. It is used with [Interaction Mode](/en/docs/manual/middle/states/mode). This document introduces the Built-in behaviors in G6. Besides, you can register a type of [Custom Behavior](/zh/docs/manual/advanced/custom-behavior). The document [Interaction Mode](/en/docs/manual/middle/states/mode) introduces how to configure the Behaviors onto the graph.

## Built-in Behavior

All the basic graphics Shapes, Items(nodes/edges) can be interacted by events. To achieve it with versatility, there are 14 built-in Behaviors in G6.

### drag-combo
Supported by V3.5 or later versions.

- Description: Allows users to drag combo;
- Configurations: 
  - `type: 'drag-combo'`;
  - `enableDelegate`: Whether activate `delegate` when dragging combos, which means whether to use a virtual rect moved with the dragging mouse instead of the combo. The effect is shown in the figures below. `false` by default;
  - `delegateStyle`: The style of the `delegate` when dragging the combo with delegate;
  - `onlyChangeComboSize`: Supported by V3.5 or later vertions. Only Change the size of the prarent combo whose child combo to be dragged, which means do not change the hierarchy structures of combos and nodes. `false` by default;
  - `activeState`: The state's name(string) of the entered combo to be dragged over, coordinating with the configuration in `comboStateStyles` to define the state styles when instantiating a graph. It is empty by default;
  - `selectedState`: The state's name(string) when combo is selected, `'selected'` by default.

**Default Configuration**

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  modes: {
    default: ['drag-combo'],
  },
});
```

Configure the styles for enableDelegate or activeState:

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  modes: {
    default: [{
      type: 'drag-combo',
      enableDelegate: true,
      activeState: 'actived'
    }],
  },
  comboStateStyles: {
    actived: {
      stroke: 'red',
      lineWidth: 3
    }
  }
});
```

### collapse-expand-combo
Supported by V3.5 or later.

- Description: collapse or expand Combo;
- Configurations: 
  - `type: 'collapse-expand-combo'`;
  - `trigger`: Specify which key to hold for collapse and expand combo. `dblclick` by default. Options: `'click'`, `'dblclick'`.

**Default Configuration**

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  modes: {
    default: ['collapse-expand-combo'],
  },
});
```

Configure the trigger to be 'click':

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  modes: {
    default: [{
      type: 'collapse-expand-combo',
      trigger: 'click'
    }],
  },
});
```


### drag-canvas

- Description: Allows users drag canvas;
- Configurations: 
  - `type: 'drag-canvas'`;
  - `direction`: The direction of dragging that is allowed. Options: `'x'`, `'y'`, `'both'`. `'both'` by default.

**Default Configuration**

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  modes: {
    default: ['drag-canvas'],
  },
});
```

By default, the x and y directions are both allowed.

**Configuration**

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  modes: {
    default: [
      {
        type: 'drag-canvas',
        direction: 'x',
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

The canvas can be dragged along x direction only.<br /><img src='https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_f8c6a0/afts/img/A*54yxRrW1A7sAAAAAAAAAAABkARQnAQ' width=400 alt='img'/>

### zoom-canvas

- Description: Zoom the canvas;
- Configurations: 
  - `type: 'zoom-canvas'`;
  - `sensitivity`: The sensitivity of the zooming, range from 1 to 10. `5` by default.

**Tips: Assign values for `minZoom` and  `maxZoom` on the graph to limit the zooming ratio.**

### drag-node

- Description: Allows users drag nodes;
- Configurations: 
  - `type: 'drag-node'`;
  - `delegateStyle`: The drawing properties when the nodes are dragged. `{ strokeOpacity: 0.6, fillOpacity: 0.6 }` by default;
  - `updateEdge`: Whether to update all connected edges when dragging nodes. `true` by default.
  - `enableDelegate`: Whether activate `delegate` when dragging nodes, which means whether to use a virtual rect moved with the dragging mouse instead of the node. The effect is shown in the figures below. `false` by default;
  - `onlyChangeComboSize`:Supported by V3.5 or later vertions. Only Change the size of the prarent combo whose child node to be dragged, which means do not change the hierarchy structures of combos and nodes. `false` by default;
  - `comboActiveState`: Supported by V3.5 or later vertions. The state's name(string) of the entered combo to be dragged over, coordinating with the configuration in `comboStateStyles` to define the state styles when instantiating a graph. It is empty by default;
  - `selectedState`: Supported by V3.5 or later vertions.  The state's name(string) when combo is selected, `'selected'` by default.

**Default Configuration**

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  modes: {
    default: ['drag-node'],
  },
});
```

  modes: {
    default: [
      {
        type: 'drag-node',
        enableDelegate: true,
      },

### click-select

- Description: Select a node by clicking. Cancel the selected state by clicking the node agian or clicking the canvas;
- Configurations:
  - `type: 'click-select'`;
  - `multiple`: Whether to allow multiple selection. `true` by default. `false` means multiple selection is not allowed, and the `trigger` will not take effect.
  - `trigger`: Specify which key to hold for multiple selection. `shift` by default, which means multiple selection is activated when the shift button is pressed. Options: `'shift'`, `'ctrl'`, `'alt'`, and so on.

**Default Configuration**

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  modes: {
    default: ['click-select'],
  },
});
```

Press **`Shift`** button to select more items.<br /><img src='https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_f8c6a0/afts/img/A*mOiIQqBof8sAAAAAAAAAAABkARQnAQ' width=400 alt='img'/>

**Configuration**

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  modes: {
    default: [
      {
        type: 'click-select',
        trigger: 'ctrl',
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

With the configuration above, users are allowed to select more than one nodes when pressing **Ctrl**. You can also assign **Alt** for it. But the multiple selection is turned off when `multiple` is `false`, and the `trigger` will not take effect any more.

### tooltip

- Description: The tooltip for node;
- Configurations:
  - `type: 'tooltip'`;
  - `formatText(model)`: Format function, returns a text string or an HTML element;
  - `offset`: the offset of the tooltip to the mouse.
  - `shouldBegin(e)`: Whether allow the tooltip the show up;
  - `shouldUpdate(e)`: Whether allow the tooltip to be updated.

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  container: 'mountNode',
  width: 500,
  height: 500,
  modes: {
    default: [
      {
        type: 'tooltip',
        formatText(model) {
          return model.xxx;
        },
        offset: 10
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

**Tips: Since there are no styles for tooltip in G6, you need to define the styles for it as:**

```css
.g6-tooltip {
  padding: 10px 6px;
  color: #444;
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9);
  border: 1px solid #e2e2e2;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
```

### edge-tooltip

The usage of edge-tooltip is similar to tooltip. It will be activated when the user hover the mouse onto an edge.

- Description: The tooltip for edge;
- Configurations:
  - `type: 'edge-tooltip'`;
  - `formatText(model)`: Format function, returns a text string or an HTML element;
  - `offset`: the offset of the tooltip to the mouse;
  - `shouldBegin(e)`: Whether allow the tooltip the show up;
  - `shouldUpdate(e)`: Whether allow the tooltip to be updated.

### activate-relations

- Description: Highlight the node and its related nodes and edges when the mouse enter the node;
- Configurations:
  - `type: 'activate-relations'`;
  - `trigger: 'mouseenter'`. `mousenter` means acitvating when the mouse enter a node; `click` means activating when the mouse click a node;
  - `activeState: 'active'`. The state name when the node is activated. When `activate-relations` is activated, the related nodes and edges will have this state. `active` by default. It can be combined with `nodeStyle` and `edgeStyle` of graph to enrich the visual effect;
  - `inactiveState: 'inactive'`. The state name when of the node is inactivated. All the nodes and edges which are not activated by `activate-relations` will have this state. `inactive` by default. It can be combined with `nodeStyle` and `edgeStyle` of graph to enrich the visual effect;
  - `resetSelected`: Whether to reset the selected nodes when highlight the related nodes. `false` by default, which means the selected state will not be covered by `activate-relations`.

<br />**Default Configuration**<br />

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  modes: {
    default: ['activate-relations'],
  },
});
```

The selected state of the selected node will be maintained after the `activate-relations` operation by default.<br /><img src='https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_f8c6a0/afts/img/A*bG31RqbM4JMAAAAAAAAAAABkARQnAQ' width=400 alt='img'/>

**Configuration**

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  modes: {
    default: [
      {
        type: 'activate-relations',
        resetSelected: true,
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

Assign `true` to `resetSelected` to reset the selected states for nodes after the `activate-relations` operation.

### brush-select

- Description: Allows uers to select nodes by brushing;
- Configurations:
  - `type: 'brush-select'`;
  - `brushStyle`: The styles of the marquee. It contains four configurations: `fill`、`fillOpacity`、`stroke` and `lineWidth`;
  - `onSelect(nodes)`: The callback function when selecting a node. `nodes` is the selected ndoes;
  - `onDeselect(nodes)`: The callback function when canceling selections. `nodes` is the selected ndoes;
  - `selectedState`: The state of the selected nodes. `'selected'` by default;
  - `includeEdges`: Whether to select the edges when selecting by brushing. `true` by default. `false` means do not select the edges.
  - `trigger`: The trigger button for this operation. `'shift'` by default, which means the select by brushing operation will be activated by pressing Shift button. Options: `'shift'`, `'ctrl' / 'control'`, `'alt'` and `'drag'`, not case sensitive:
    - `'shift'`: Select by brushing when Shift is pressed;
    - `'ctrl' / 'control'`: Select by brushing when Ctrl is pressed;
    - `'alt'`: Select by brushing when Alt is pressed;
    - `'drag'`: Select by brushing without any pressed buttons. Note that it will conflict with the `drag-canvas`.

**Default Configuration**

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  modes: {
    default: ['brush-select'],
  },
});
```

Select by brushing when the Shift button is pressed by default. And the edges are selectable as well.<br /><img src='https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_f8c6a0/afts/img/A*IJizQonX75wAAAAAAAAAAABkARQnAQ' width=400 alt='img'/>

**Configuration**

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  modes: {
    default: [
      {
        type: 'brush-select',
        trigger: 'ctrl',
        includeEdges: false,
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

By the configurations above, the operation is activated when the Ctrl button is pressed, and the edges will not be selected during the process.<br /><img src='https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_f8c6a0/afts/img/A*1xNZT7mPFK4AAAAAAAAAAABkARQnAQ' width=400 alt='img'/>

**Conflict Configuration: **

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  modes: {
    default: [
      'drag-canvas',
      {
        type: 'brush-select',
        trigger: 'drag',
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

When the `trigger` in `brush-select` is assigned to `drag`, an the `drag-canvas` exists in this mode, their operation will conflict.<br /><img src='https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_f8c6a0/afts/img/A*umffRa8rHtUAAAAAAAAAAABkARQnAQ' width=400 alt='img'/>

It is obvious that the selecting by brushing is activated while dragging the canvas. To avoid this situation, we can assign other values for `trigger` in `brush-select`. Besides, the following solution also works:

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  modes: {
    default: ['drag-canvas'],
    brush: [
      {
        type: 'brush-select',
        trigger: 'drag',
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

It is a solution to put these two conflicting events into two mdoes. They will be activated on different graph modes. Dragging operation corresponds to `drag-canvas` in the default mode. When user switch the state to brush mode by `graph.setModel('brush')`, the dragging operation will be responsed by `brush-select` instead. Refer to [Mode](/en/docs/manual/middle/states/mode) for more information.

### collapse-expand

- Description: Collapse or expand a subtree on a treeGraph;
- Attension: If you want to collapse a subtree by default when render the Graph in the first time, you can assign `collapsed: true` to the root of the subtree in its data. If you want to control the subtree to collapse/expand by code, you can also assign the `collapsed` for the root of the subtree and call `treeGraph.layout()` to make it take effect;
- Configurations:
  - `type: 'collapse-expand'`;
  - `trigger`: The operation for collapsing and expanding. Options: `click` and `dblclick`. `click` by default;
  - `onChange`: The callback function after collapsing or expanding. **Warining**: it will be removed from V3.1.2.

**Usage**

```javascript
const graph = new G6.TreeGraph({
  modes: {
    default: [
      {
        type: 'collapse-expand',
        trigger: 'click',
        onChange(item, collapsed) {
          const data = item.get('model').data;
          data.collapsed = collapsed;
          return true;
        },
      },
      'drag-canvas',
      'zoom-canvas',
    ],
  },
});
```

### collapse-expand-group

- Description: Collapse or expand a node group;
- Configurations:
  - `type: 'collapse-expand-group'`
  - `trigger`: The operation for collapsing and expanding. Options: `click` and `dblclick`. `dblclick` by default, which means double click.

**Default Configuration**

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  modes: {
    default: ['collapse-expand-group'],
  },
});
```

**Configuration**<br />Assign `trigger` to **`click`**, the collapsing or expanding a node group will be triggered by click.

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  modes: {
    default: [
      {
        type: 'collapse-expand-group',
        trigger: 'click',
      },
    ],
  },
});
