## Introduction

Graph layouts are the algorithms arranging the node positions to obtain a understandable visualizaiton. According to the differences of data strucutre, the layouts can be categorized into: general graph layout and tree graph layout. There are several layout algorithms for them respectively. By utilizing the built-in layouts, [Translating the layouts and their configurations, translating the data](#layout-transformation-mechanism) can be achieved. Besides, G6 provides the [Web-Worker](#web-worker) for general graph layout in case layout calculation takes too long to block page interaction.

Besides, G6 supports [Custom Layout](/en/docs/manual/advanced/custom-layout) mechanism for users to design their own layout algorithm.

In fact, 'layout' is a free mechanism in G6. The built-in layouts only calculate and manipulate the `x` and `y` in node data. In other word, users can assign `x` and `y` to nodes by any other ways including the algorithms from the third-party libraries. Once G6 find the `x` and `y` information on data, it will render the graph according to it.

In this ducoment, we will introduce the layout algorithms in detail.

## G6 Layouts Overview

### Graph

- [Random Layout](#random): Randomizes the node postions;
- [Force Layout](#force): Classical force-directed layout;
- [Fruchterman Layout](#fruchterman): A kind of force-directed layout;
- [Circular Layout](#circular): Arranges the nodes on a circle;
- [Radial Layout](#radial): Arranges the nodes around a focus node radially;
- [MDS Layout](#mds): Multidemensional Scaling;
- [Dagre Layout](#dagre): Arranges the nodes hierarchically;
- [Concentric Layout](#concentric): Arranges the nodes on concentric circles;
- [Grid Layout](#grid): Arranges the nodes on grid.
- [Combo Force Layout](#combo-force)：*New feature of V3.5* Designed for graph with combos.


### TreeGraph

- [CompactBox Layout](#compactbox);
- [Dendrogram Layout](#dendrogram): Arrange the leaves on the same level;
- [Intended Layout](#intended);
- [Mindmap Layout](#mindmap).

## Graph

### Configure the Graph

Configure `layout` to the Graph instance to assign the layout methods and their configurations. The following code assigns the layout with `type: 'force'`, which means the classical force-directed layout algorithm. The configurations `preventOverlap: true` and `nodeSize: 30` are assigned to prevent node overlappings, where the `nodeSize` is used for collide detection. More layout configurations can be found in the following sections.

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  // ...                      // Other configurations for the graph
  layout: {
    // Object, the layout configuration. Random layout by default
    type: 'force',
    preventOverlap: true,
    nodeSize: 30,
    // ...                    // Other configurations for the layout
  },
});
```

Different layout algorithms have different configurations. For all the general graph layout algorithms in G6, you can enable the web-worker by configure `workerEnabled: true` in the `layout` configuration above. With web-worker, layout algorithms performed on large data with high cost will not block the web page.

When the `layout` is not assigned:

- If there is position information with `x` and `y` in node data, G6 renders the graph with them;
- If the position information does not exist in the node data, Random Layout will take effect by default.

## TreeGraph

In order to handle the tree data structure, G6 extends Graph to TreeGraph. Refer to: [TreeGraph API](/en/docs/api/layout/TreeGraph). TreeGraph is appropriate for visualizing hierarchy data.

### Configure the TreeGraph

Similar to Graph, assign `layout` to Graph instance to set the layout for a TreeGraph. The [Expand/Collapse](/en/docs/manual/middle/states/defaultBehavior/#collapse-expand) behavior can be assigned to the TreeGraph by `modes`.

```javascript
const graph = new G6.TreeGraph({
  container: 'mountNode',
  modes: {
    default: [
      {
        // Assign the collapse/expand behavior
        type: 'collapse-expand',
      },
      'drag-canvas',
    ],
  },
  // Assign the layout
  layout: {
    type: 'dendrogram', // Layout type
    direction: 'LR', // Layout direction is from the left to the right. Options: 'H' / 'V' / 'LR' / 'RL' / 'TB' / 'BT'
    nodeSep: 50, // The distance between nodes
    rankSep: 100, // The distance between adjacent levels
  },
});
```

### Layouts for TreeGraph

## Layout Transformation Mechanism

G6 provides two layout transformations:

- `updateLayout(params)`: Layout methods and configurations transformation;
- `changeData()`: Data transformation.

### Layout Methods and Configuration Transformation

**Interface Definition:**

```javascript
/**
 * Change the layout or its configurations
 * @param {String | object} cfg New layout configurations
 * If the cfg is a String or an object with the property type, and the type is different from the current layout method, the layout method will be changed into the new one;
 * Only change the configurations for the current layout otherwise
 */
updateLayout(cfg);
```

**Change the Layout Method:** <br />If the `cfg` is a `String` or an object with property `type`, and the type is different from the current layout method, the layout method will be changed into the new one;

**Change the Configurations Only:** <br />If the `cfg` is an object without property `type`, or the `type` is the same as the current layout method, only the configurations for the current layout will be changed.

### Data Transformation

**Interface Definition:**

```javascript
/**
 * Change the source data, render the graph with new data
 * @param {object} data source data
 * @return {object} this
 */
changeData(data);
```

### Transformation Example

#### Expected Effect

In the first stage, the graph is arranged by random layout. Transform to force layout with node overlappings after 2000ms, force layout without node overlappings after 4000ms, change data to `data2` after 6000ms.<br /><img src='https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_f8c6a0/afts/img/A*6k-iQ405hEEAAAAAAAAAAABkARQnAQ' width=600 alt='img'/>

## Subgraph Layout

At present, the subgraph layout mechanism is independent to the graph layout. You can instantiate the layout method and load the data of subgraph onto the layout instance. This mechanism allows users to utilize G6's layout algorithms to calculate the node positions, and render the graph with another rendering engine.

### Usage

```javascript
// Instantiate the Layout
const subgraphLayout = new G6.Layout['force']({
  center: [500, 450],
});

// Initialize the layout with sugbraph data
subgraphLayout.init({
  nodes: subGraphNodes,
  edges: subGraphEdges,
});

// Execute the layout
subgraphLayout.execute();

// Update the node positions after subgraph layout
graph.positionsAnimate();
```

## Web-Worker

The layout algorithm costs a lot in large scale graph visualization. If you config the layout for a graph, the layout algorithm must be done before rendering. In some web applications, this process will block the page and the end users will not able to interact with other components of the page. To address this issue, G6 provids the Web-Worker for **General Graph**. You only need to assign `workerEnabled` to `true` when configuring the layout. For example:

```javascript
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  ...                      // Other configurations for graph
  layout: {                // Object, layout methods and its configurations
  	type: 'fruchterman',
    workerEnabled: true,   // enable Web-Worker
    // ...                 // other configurations for the layout
  }
});
```
