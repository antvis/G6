The events in this chapter can be binded or unbinded to graph by [graph.on](/en/docs/api/Graph/#oneventname-handler) and [graph.off](/en/docs/api/Graph/#offeventname-handler).

The parameters of callbacks for common events, Node events, and Edge events are described in [Behavior API](/en/docs/api/Behavior).

## Interaction Events

Listen to the interaction events such as `click`, `mousemove` by the following way:

```
graph.on(eventName, evt => {
  // some operations
})
```

Where, the event object `evt` has the properties:

- `type`: The type of the event
- `name`: The name of the event
- `x`: The x coordinate on the canvas
- `y`: The y coordinate on the canvas
- `clientX`: The x coordinate about the client
- `clientY`: The y coordinate about the client
- `canvasX`: The x coordinate about parent DOM of the canvas
- `canvasY`: The y coordinate about parent DOM of the canvas

（The differences between x/y, clientX/clientY, and canvasX/canvasY can be found in [Coordinate Systems in G6](/en/docs/manual/advanced/coordinate-system)）

- `item`: The item being manipulated, which can be a node, an edge, or a Combo）
- `target`: The target [Shape](/zh/docs/manual/middle/elements/shape/shape-keyshape) on the `item` being manupulated, or the canvas instance
- `bubbles`: Whether bubbles
- `defaultPrevented`: Whether prevent the original event
- `originalEvent`: The original client event object. where the `button` can be used to distinguish the left/middle/right button of the mouse on some events like `click` or `dblclick`
- `timeStamp`: The time stamp the event triggered
- `propagationStopped`: Wheher stop the propogation
- `propagationPath`: The triggering path

`eventName` can be refered to the following parts.

## Timing Events

Before and after being called some functions, G6 exports the timing events. These timing events can be listened by the following way:

```
graph.on(timingEventName, evt => {
  // some operations
})
```

`timingEventName` is shown below:
