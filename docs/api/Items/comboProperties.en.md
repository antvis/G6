## Combo


Except for the common properties, there are special configurations for each type of built-in Combos. The `style`s of them depend on their keyShape. The common properties for built-in Combos can be refered to:

- [Common Configurations for Built-in Combos](/en/docs/manual/middle/elements/combos/defaultCombo#common-property);
- [Common Styles for Built-in Combos](/en/docs/manual/middle/elements/combos/defaultCombo#style);
- [Common Label Configurations for Built-in Combos](/en/docs/manual/middle/elements/combos/defaultCombo#label-and-labelcfg).

The special properties for each built-in Combos can be found in the subdocuments of [Built-in Combos](/en/docs/manual/middle/elements/combos/defaultCombo).
