## Edge

Except for the common properties, there are special configurations for each type of built-in Edges. The `style`s of them depend on their keyShape. The common properties for built-in Edges can be refered to:

- [Common Configurations for Built-in Edges](/en/docs/manual/middle/elements/edges/defaultEdge#the-common-property);
- [Common Styles for Built-in Edges](/en/docs/manual/middle/elements/edges/defaultEdge#style);
- [Common Label Configurations for Built-in Edges](/en/docs/manual/middle/elements/edges/defaultEdge#label-and-labelcfg).

The special properties for each built-in Edges can be found in the subdocuments of [Built-in Edges](/en/docs/manual/middle/elements/edges/defaultEdge).
