order: 8
---

Graphics Group (hereinafter referred to as Group) in G6 is similar to <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/SVG/Element/g' target='_blank'> `<g>` tag in SVG </a>: Group a container of a group of graphics. The transformations on a Group such as clipping, rotating, zooming, and translating will be applied to all the children of the Group. The properties like color and position will also be inherited by its children. Besides, Group can be nested for complicated objects. For more information about Group, please refer to [Graphics Group](/en/docs/manual/advanced/keyconcept/graphics-group) document.


## Instance Declaration 
```javascript
const group = new Group(cfgs);
```


## Functions


### addGroup(param, cfg)
Add a new group to the group.


**Parameters**

| Name | Type |
| --- | --- |
| param | Function / Object / undefined |
| cfg | Object |



**Usage**

```javascript
group.addGroup({
	id: 'groupId'
})
```



### addShape(type, cfgs)
Add a new shape into the group<br /><span style="background-color: rgb(251, 233, 231); color: rgb(139, 53, 56)"><strong>⚠️Attention:</strong></span> the clip and transform operations will affect all the shapes in the group. The graphics and their properties are introduced in [Shape API](/en/docs/api/Shape)。


**Parameters**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type | String | The type of the shape. Options: `'rect'`, `'circle'`, `'fan'`, `'ellipse'`, `'marker'`, `'image'`, and so on. Please refer to [Graphics Shape Properties](/en/docs/manual/advanced/keyconcept/shape-and-properties) document |
| cfg | Object | The configurations of the shape. |


The `cfg` above contains:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| attrs | Object | The style configurations for the shape. e.g. `{x: 0, y: 10, fill: '#0f0'}` |
| name | String | The name of the shape which can be not unique. It is required for each shape in G6 3.3. Besides, `name` can be used for searching this shape, e.g. `const shape = group.find(element => element.name === 'shape-name')`. The usage of find can be found at [find(fn)](#findfn) |
| zIndex | Number | The visual index of the shape, similar to z-index of DOM. It is not required. `group.sort()` will sort the visual index of the shapes inside the group according to their zIndex |


**Usage**

```javascript
group.addShape('rect', {
	attrs: {
  	fill: 'red',
    shadowOffsetX: 10,
    shadowOffsetY: 10,
    shadowColor: 'blue',
    shadowBlur: 10,
    opacity: 0.8
  },
  // must be assigned in G6 3.3 and later versions. it can be any value you want
  name: 'rect-shape',
  zIndex: 1
})
```

### find(fn)

```javascript
const group1 = group.findById('group1');
```



### findAll(fn)
Find all the elements that match the rule.<br />The type of the return value: [ Object ]


**Parameters**


| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fn | Function | Customized callback function. |



**Usage**

```javascript
const children = group.findAll(function(item) {
    return item.get('id') < 10;       // get all the elements with the id smaller than 10
});
```


### getShape(x,y)
Get the top shape which is on (x, y). <br />The type of the return value: Object


**Parameters**


| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | number | x coordinate |
| y | number | y coordinate |



**Usage**

```javascript
// Get the top element on (10, 30)
const element = group.getShape(10, 30)
```


### getFirst()
Get **the first** element of the group. <br />The type of the return value: Object


**Usage**

```javascript
const child = group.getFirst()

// Equal to
const childrens = group.get('children')
const child = childrens[0]
```


### getLast()
Get the last element of the group. <br />The type of the return value: Object


**Usage**

```javascript
const child = group.getLast()

// Equal to
const childrens = group.get('children')
const child = childrens[childrens.length - 1]
```


### getChildByIndex(index）
Get the `index`-th child of the group started from `0`.<br />The type of the return value: Object


**Parameters**


| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| index | number | The index of the child. 0 by default. |

### sort()
