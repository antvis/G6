There are several plugins in G6 which can be used inside and ouside G6 freely.

- [Grid](#grid)
- [Minimap](#minimap)
- [Edge Bundling](#edge-bundling)

## Configure to Graph

You only need to instantiate it and configure the minimap onto the instance of Graph:

```javascript
// Instantialize the Grid plugin
const grid = new G6.Grid();
// Instantialize the Minimap plugin
const minimap = new G6.Minimap();
const graph = new G6.Graph({
  //... Other configurations
  plugins: [grid, minimap], // Configure Grid and Minimap to the graph
});
```

## Grid

Grid draw grids on the canvas.

Use the code in [Configure to Graph](#configure-to-graph) to instantiate grid plugin with the following configurations.

### Configuration

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| img | Srting | base64 formatted string for the grid image |


## Minimap

Minimap is a tool for quick preview and exploration on large graph.

It can be configured to adjust the styles and functions.

### Configuration

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| container | Object | The DOM container of Minimap. The plugin will generate a new one if `container` is not defined |
| className | String | The className of the DOM element of the Minimap |
| viewportClassName | String | The className of the DOM element of the view port on the Minimap |
| type | String | Render type. Options: `'default'`: Render all the graphics shapes on the graph; `'keyShape'`: Only render the keyShape of the items on the graph to reach better performance; `'delegate'`: Only render the delegate of the items on the graph to reach better performance. Performance: `'default'` < `'keyShape'` < `'delegate'`. `'default'` by default |
| size | Array | The size of the Minimap |
| delegateStyle | Object | Takes effect when `type` is `'delegate'`. The style of the delegate of the items on the graph |

The `delegateStyle` has the properties:

| Name        | Type   | Description             |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| fill        | String | Filling color           |
| stroke      | String | Stroke color            |
| lineWidth   | Number | The width of the stroke |
| opacity     | Number | Opacity                 |
| fillOpacity | Number | Filling opacity         |

## Edge Bundling

In complex graph with large number of edges, edge bundling can help you to improve the visual clutter.

The edge bundling plugin can be configured to adjust the styles and functions.

### Configuration

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| K | Number | 0.1 | The strength of the bundling |
| lambda | Number | 0.1 | The initial step length |
| divisions | Number | 1 | The initial number of division on each edge. It will be multipled by `divRate` in each cycle |
| divRate | Number | 2 | The rate of the divisions increasement. Large number means smoother result, but the performance will be worse when the number is too large |
| cycles | Number | 6 | The number of outer interations |
| iterations | Number | 90 | The initial number of inner interations. It will be multiplied by `iterRate` in each cycle |
| iterRate | Number | 0.6666667 | The rate of the iterations decreasement |
| bundleThreshold | Number | 0.6 | The edge similarity threshold for bundling. Large number means the edges in one bundle have smaller similarity, in other words, more edges in one bundle |
