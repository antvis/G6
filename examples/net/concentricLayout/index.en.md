Concentric Layout places the nodes on concentric circles.

## Usage

As the demo below, you can deploy it in `layout` while instantiating Graph. it can also be used for [Subgraph Layout](/zh/docs/manual/middle/layout/#%E5%AD%90%E5%9B%BE%E5%B8%83%E5%B1%80). This algorithm will order the nodes according to the parameters first, then the node in the front of the order will be placed on the center of the concentric circles.
