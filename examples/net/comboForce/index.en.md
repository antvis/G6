title: Combo Force Layout
order: 10
---

*It is a new feature of V3.5.* Combo Force is designed for the graph with combos based on classical force directed layout algorith. It modifies the forces between nodes according to their combo infomation to achieve a final result with clustering nodes inside each combo and no overlappings.

## Usage

We suggest to use `'comboForce'` for the graph with combos. Other layouts in G6 are also availabel, but they do not consider the combo infomation.
