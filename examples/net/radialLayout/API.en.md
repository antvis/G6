## center
**Type**: Array<br />**Example**: [ 0, 0 ]<br />**Default**: The center of the graph<br />**Required**: false<br />**Description**: The center of the layout.


## linkDistance
**Type**: Number<br />**Default**: 50<br />**Required**: false<br />**Description**: The edge length.


## maxIteration
**Type**: Number<br />**Default**: 1000<br />**Required**: false<br />**Description**: The max iteration number.


## focusNode
**Type**: String | Object<br />**Default**: null<br />**Required**: false<br />**Description**: The focus node of the radial layout. The first node of the data is the default value. It can be the id of a node or the node item.


## unitRadius
**Type**: Number<br />**Default**: 100<br />**Required**: false<br />**Description**: The separation between adjacent circles. If `unitRadius` is not assigned, the layout will fill the canvas automatically.


## preventOverlap
**Type**: Boolean<br />**Default**: false<br />**Required**: false<br />**Description**: Whether to prevent node overlappings. To activate preventing node overlappings, `nodeSize` is required, which is used for collide detection. The size in the node data will take effect if `nodeSize` is not assigned.


## nodeSize
**Type**: Number<br />**Default**: 10<br />**Required**: false<br />**Description**: The diameter of the node. It is used for preventing node overlappings


## nodeSpacing
**Type**: Number / Function
<br />**Default**: 0
<br />**Required**: false 
<br />**Example**: Example 1:  10
<br />Example 2:  

```javascript
d => {
  // d is a node
  if (d.id === 'node1') {
    return 100;
  }
  return 10;
}
```

<br />**Description**: 
Takes effect when `preventOverlap` is `true`. It is the minimum distance between nodes to prevent node overlappings. It can be a function to define different distances for different nodes (example 2)


## maxPreventOverlapIteration
**Type**: Number<br />**Default**: 200<br />**Required**: false<br />**Description**: The maximum iteration number of preventing node overlappings


## strictRadial
**Type**: Boolean<br />**Default**: true<br />**Required**: false<br />**Description**: Whether to layout the graph as strict radial, which means the nodes will be arranged on each circle strictly. Takes effect only when `preventOverlap` is `true`

- When `preventOverlap` is `true`, and `strictRadial` is `false`, the overlapped nodes are arranged along their circles strictly. But for the situation that there are too many nodes on a circle to be arranged, the overlappings might not be eliminated completely
- When `preventOverlap` is `true`, and `strictRadial` is `true` , the overlapped nodes can be arranged around their circle with small offsets.

> （Left）preventOverlap = false.（Center）preventOverlap = false, strictRadial = true. (Right)preventOverlap = false, strictRadial = false.



## sortBy
**Type**: String<br />**Default**: undefined<br />**Required**: false<br />**Description**: Sort the nodes of the same level. `undefined` by default, which means place the nodes with connections as close as possible; `'data'` means place the node according to the ordering in data, the closer the nodes in data ordering, the closer the nodes will be placed. `sortBy` also can be assigned to any name of property in nodes data, such as `'cluster'`, `'name'` and so on (make sure the property exists in the data)



## sortStrength
**Type**: Number<br />**Default**: 10<br />**Required**: false<br />**Description**: The strength to sort the nodes in the same circle. Larger number means place the nodes with smaller distance of `sortBy` more closely. Takes effect only when `sortBy` is not `undefined`


## workerEnabled
**Type**: Boolean<br />**Default**: false<br />**Required**: false<br />**Description**: Whether to enable the web-worker in case layout calculation takes too long to block page interaction
