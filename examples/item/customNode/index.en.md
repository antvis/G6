The custom node mechanism in G6 allows users to design their own node when there are no appropriate built-in nodes for their scenario.

Since from G6 V3.6.0, G6 nodes support the use of G2 statistical charts, such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, dashboards, etc. If you want to use these statistical charts, by importing the `@antv/chart-node-g6` package to implement. Refer to [G2 Documentation](https://g2.antv.vision/zh/docs/manual/tutorial/overview).

For more information on how to use G2 charts in G6 nodes, please refer to [Document](https://www.yuque.com/antv/g6-blog/pwg00q).
