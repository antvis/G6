Graph algorithms provide one of the most effective methods for analyzing relational data. They describe how to process graphs to discover some qualitative or quantitative measures. Graph algorithms are based on graph theory and use the relationship between them to structure and change complex systems. We can use these algorithms to discover hidden information, verify business assumptions, and change behavior to make predictions. This demo shows how to use `findShortestPath` for finding the shortest path between two selected end nodes, and then highlight the path.
