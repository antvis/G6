Buit-in behavior `'create-edge'` is a new feature of V3.6.2, which allows the users to create a new edge by some operations.

## Usage

`'create-edge'` allows the end users to create a new edge by clicking the source and target node, or dragging from a source node to a target node. For more detail, please refer to [create-edge](/zh/docs/manual/middle/states/defaultBehavior#create-edge).
