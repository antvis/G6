Buit-in behavior `'lasso-select'` is a new feature of V3.6.2, which allows the users select items by drawing a irregular polygon as lasso.

## Usage

`'lasso-select'` can be configured with different `trigger` to distinguish the other conflict behaviors, e.g. `'drag-canvas'`. For more detail, please refer to [lasso-select](/en/docs/manual/middle/states/defaultBehavior#lasso-select).
