order: 5
---

An American airlines graph with edge bundling powered by G6. Edge bundling helps developers to reduce the visual clutter.

## Usage

On large graph, edge bundling helps developers to reduce the visual clutter, and visualizes the graph with clearer trend and structures. To show more statistical information, we draw each node with a pie chart which indicates the ratio of arrival(orange) and leaving(cyan) airlines on the corresponding city. The gradient colors of the edges map the direction of airlines. The tooltip with longitude and latitude information will show up when user hovers on each node.
