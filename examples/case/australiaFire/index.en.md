This graph demonstrates the fire affectness and population on different cities of Australia. The data comes from NASA, which includes the fire points of Australia detected by the satellites. [Link of the data](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/active_fire/#firms-shapefile).

The root node represents Australia. The nodes on the second level are the states of Australia. The leaves of the graph represent the main cities of Australia. The sizes of the leaves indicate the population of the corresponding cities. The bars on the leaves show the number of the fire points in the corresponding city everyday, which is detected by the satellites. The color of a leaf is mapped to the degree of the fire effectiveness in the region, which is the average brightness of the fire points in the region detected by the satellites.
